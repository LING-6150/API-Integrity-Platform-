# 🛡️ API Integrity Platform

A secure, scalable backend platform designed to enforce API-level risk control, prevent system abuse, and provide enterprise-grade trust assurance. Built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud Gateway, this project enables fine-grained access control, real-time monitoring, and high-concurrency support for modern microservice ecosystems.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The API Integrity Platform protects backend services from unauthorized access, misuse, and abnormal traffic by introducing:

- 🔐 **RBAC-based access control** with Sa-Token + JWT
- 📊 **Real-time risk detection & usage monitoring**
- 🌐 **WebSocket-based streaming for live metrics**
- 📎 **Secure multi-tenant collaboration architecture**
- ⚙️ **Audit logging and compliance-ready reporting**

## 🧩 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ **RBAC Permission System** | Role-based access + method-level validation using AOP interceptors |
| ✅ **Dynamic Data Sharding** | Optimized MySQL partitioning via ShardingSphere (45% latency reduction) |
| ✅ **Real-Time Collaboration** | WebSocket + event-driven architecture with "edit-locks" for concurrency |
| ✅ **High-Throughput Processing** | Lock-free Disruptor queues for async message pipelines (270% throughput gain) |
| ✅ **Audit & Compliance** | Structured logging + reporting for API access transparency |
| ✅ **Production-Ready Deployment** | 99.9% uptime on Linux + Nginx with Dockerized microservices and CI/CD
